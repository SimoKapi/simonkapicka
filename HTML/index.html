            <p>This website is dedicated to providing information about me, Simon Kapicka, as well as providing me with a platform to share,
                test and develop my own projects, and to make them publically accessible to anyone who wishes to see or try them out.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read some information about me in the About tab, see my past projects and programs in my Portfolio, try out some of my
                apps which I have made usable in the Applications section, or reach out to me in the Contact tab. Clicking my name on the top left will 
                bring you back to this page, so you don't get lost.
