            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Simon Kapicka, and I am a high school student studing at Nov√Ω PORG in Prague, Czech Republic.
                I'm currently 16 years old and ever since I was 8 I've always been interested in 
                the world of technology, specifically programming and software development.</p>
            <p>My interest in this field began at the age of 8, when I was sick and had to miss school. My dad decided he would
                show me <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch from M.I.T.</a>, and since then I've had one foot in technology at all times
            </p>
            <p>Recently, I've started getting more involved in programming, as I realized the true potential and my ability to wield it. 
                I joined the IT team of PORGMUN, an annual student debate conference hosted by our school. I participated with some of the 
                smaller additions to the website, accessible <a target="_blank" href="https://porgmun.cz">here</a>. At this time I also started working on this website.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include rock climbing, as it's a sport that I've been doing since I was about 10 years old. As of September 2023, I have a job at PizzaHut, 
                and so far it's been pretty fun and interesting. I also enjoy riding my bike from time to time.</p>
